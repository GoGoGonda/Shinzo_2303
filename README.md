Some python files used in a group project to predict heart disease based on a given dataset. 
We achieved improved accuracy of prediction from around 0.85 - 0.87 to 0.88 - 0.90 at the average score of 5-split cross validation score by the stacking model of LR, KNN, SVC, and RFC. In addition, LR is used to explain the feature of this heart disease dataset. 

All the files are not well organized. 
We conducted EDA of the given dataset, LR, KNN, SVC, DTC, RFC, XGboost, LightGBM, DNN, and the stacking model.   
SVC analysis file is not uploaded because the SVC model is an effortful product made by another group member.
